        <h1>Massively Parallel State Machine Protocol<br>[MP-SMP]</h1>
        <i>Peter Maloy, geekbrit@gmail.com, May 2012</i>
        <p>
            This document describes the capabilities and behaviour of a method for handling multiple
            concurrent processing tasks that rely on asynchronous events. The processing tasks may
            be handled within a single processing unit or across multiple processing units. Within
            a Processing Unit MP-SMP is single-threaded; a Processing Unit may therefore be an
            RTOS Task, a POSIX-like thread, a lightweight process, or code running on a processor core
            that is not running code that has preemption capability.
        </p>
        <p>
            MP-SMP is based upon the concept that complex computational engines interacting with
            external systems spend a significant amount of time waiting for events during which tasks
            that need to be carried out are blocked. MP-SMP is therefore an organizational method
            that shares available processing capacity efficiently across multiple Tasks that are in
            different stages of completion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intention is that this methodology should be implementable in any programming
            language that supports the functional requirements of the protocol, and may be run on any
            suitable operating system or RTOS, or indeed with no operating system at all, subject to
            certain limitations (for example, the implemented worker/handler functions would then have to run
            to completion within acceptable times and, be non-blocking).
        </p>
        <p>
            A primary objective for this protocol is scalability and portability; it should be possible
            to implement an MP-SMP system on a single microcontroller, or across a network of multi-core
            servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is intended that it should be functionally correct for each MP-SMP State Handler function
            to be written as if it is in a single-threaded environment - and therefore able to be tested
            within a simple test framework. The management of resource availability and Task ownership will be managed entirely within the
            MP-SMP executive.

                <h1>States</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                To create an MP-SMP system, the application developer will instantiate one or more States,
                and implement event handlers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each state can be viewed as a
                semi-autonomous event-driven engine that consists of:
                <ul>
                    <li>a Queue - containing Tasks to be carried out. Tasks will be carried out in chronological
                    order, with these exceptions:
                    <uL>
                        <li>If a Task is blocked because of Resource unavailability, the State engine can examine
                        later Tasks in the Queue to see if they can be processed.</li>
                        <li>A new incoming Event that references a particular Task will cause that Task to be
                        processed by the State engine, after which it will perform a traverse of its Queue to see
                        if any other Task can be processed at this time.
                        </li>
                    </uL>
                    </li>
                    <li>a Dispatcher. When triggered by an incoming event, this passes the referenced Task to the
                    appropriate Handler. Any incoming event may (at the developer's discretion) be used to trigger
                    a general poll of all queued Tasks to see if they can be processed further.</li>
                    <li>one or more Handlers - functions that will perform a specific operation on a Task when it
                    is in the State, depending on input events and the Task's internal state. In general, each handler
                    will start with a set of gating resource requirements such that a Queued Task can quickly be polled
                    to see if it has the resources available to be processed.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary purpose of States within MP-SMP is to manage asynchronicity. Whenever a Task
                requires a resource or an external operation that would necessitate a blocking wait, it is instead
                placed in the Queue of a State until that resource becomes available or the external
                operation has completed. This allows a high degree of lock-free operation, since shared
                resources can operate single-threaded within a State handler.
            </p>
            <p>
                A secondary characteristic of States is to encapsulate related functionality and to provide
                clean interfaces and decoupling between sections of a complex system. Each State is responsible
                for a bound set of operations on a Task, and those operations are driven by data held within
                the Task itself. There may be gating parameters that determine which Tasks from the Queue can be
                operated on at a given time, but these are passed between States in the form of Infrastructure
                Messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The absence of shared global data is intended to allow States to be migrated across multiple
                processing units, which may or may not share physical address space.
            </p>
            <h2>State Scope</h2>
            <p>
                In the simplest form, a State will exist on a single processing unit, but it is allowable for
                a State to be instantiated on multiple processing units, each of which subscribe to a State
                Router that allocates Tasks to balance the load across processing units.<br><b>[RabbitMQ or similar?]</b>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>
                <h1>Events</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                Outside the scope of an individual State, MP-SMP is entirely event-driven.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary source of Events arise from incoming data - the receipt of a new Task over
                a network interface; a new frame in a data transfer; an ADC conversion completion interrupt;
                in an interactive system a mouse click or scroll event; notification of a resource availability
                from another processing unit.
            </p>
            <p>
                A State engine's dispatcher remains idle until it receives an event, which may be to tell it that
                a new Task has been placed in its Queue, or that some resource within the system has changed that
                may allow processing to continue for one or more Tasks that are currently blocked within the State's
                Queue.
            </p>
            <p>
                An Event contains:
                <ul>
                    <li>A Task handle (may be EVENT_BROADCAST if not Task-specific)</li>
                    <li>An Event code</li>
                    <li>An Event target</li>
                </ul>
                The event target will be a State - any given event code can be handled by only one State,
                so as soon as each event is received by a Processing Unit, it is mapped onto the recipient State.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that a State may be distributes across multiple Processing Units, so the MP-SMP system
                must ensure that the event is broadcast to all instances of the State. Instances of the State
                that do not contain the referenced Task can ignore the Event.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header>
                <h1>Tasks</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                In MP-SMP, a Task should not be confused with an Operating System Task. Instead, it represents
                operation that the system has to perform. An example might be a web page request, which might go
                through a number of states:
                <ul>
                    <li>URI and parameters extraction &amp; validation</li>
                    <li>Data selection and retrieval</li>
                    <li>Template engine &amp; data formatting</li>
                    <li>HTTP transfer</li>
                </ul>
                These are handled by separate States, possibly in different threads and different cores, but all
                form a single Task, and all actions must be completed in order to complete the Task.
            </p>
            <p>
                MP-SMP is a data-driven protocol in that a system can be thought of as a series of
                data processing engines that work on blocks of data that represent the progress of
                one Task that the system must carry out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The general form of a Task descriptor is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Handle: System-wide unique identifier (reallocatable at the end of lifecycle
                    of a previous task in resource-constrained systems)</li>
                    <li>Type: System-specific information, allows easy routing to appropriate State Handlers</li>
                    <li>Payload: Task-specific data</li>
                    <li>StateData: Scratchpad area for State - this data is invalidate as soon as the Task
                    moves from one State to another, and allows the State to store temporary data within the Task
                    descriptor rather than having to perform dynamic memory operations as Tasks enter and leave its
                    Queue. Every State will see the scratchpad size and a valid/not valid flag in the StateData
                    header; the rest of the StateData block is theirs to use as required.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Note:</b> The StateData implementation is less critical for programming languages that
                perform automatic data allocation and garbage collection than, for example C/C++.
            </p>

                <h1>Infrastructure</h1>
            </header>
            <h2>Layer 1: Tasks</h2>
            <p>
                Ownership of Tasks is strictly controlled; by design, within a processing unit a Task
                may appear in one and only one State. It is however permissable to transfer ActionRequests
                to other processing units to allow parallelization of operations related to a given Task.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Important</b> This requires the current State to maintain response counters to ensure correct
                Map&rarr;Reduce operation. These response counters should probably be instantiated in the Task
                StateData field.
            </p>
            <h2>Layer 2: State Infrastructure</h2>
            <p>
                A State engine may be able to process all Tasks assigned to its Queue, or its progress
                may be gated by an external factor, such as data availability in a buffer. For this reason,
                there is a second layer of messaging. The State Infrastructure allows resource availability
                and error conditions to be broadcast around the distributed MP-SMP system independently of
                Tasks.
            </p>
            <h2>Messages</h2>
            <p>
                Where messages cross processing unit boundaries, they are sent as BSON-encoded packets.
                This removes the majority of problems associated with software versions (data is sent as
                name:type:value tuples) and allows operation across processing units that do not have
                access to share memory.
